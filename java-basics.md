Absolutely, Mohit — having even **basic Java knowledge** can definitely impress interviewers, especially at a company like **Dassault Systèmes**, where Java is mentioned in the JD alongside JavaScript.

Here’s a crisp overview with **interview-friendly Java questions + answers** that show you're comfortable with backend fundamentals.

---

## ✅ Java Overview (for JS Developers)

* **Java is statically typed**: types are declared at compile time.
* **Object-Oriented**: everything revolves around `classes`, `objects`, `inheritance`, etc.
* Java uses **JVM** (Java Virtual Machine) to run compiled `.class` files from `.java` code.
* Java has **robust memory management** using garbage collection.
* Common in enterprise applications (Spring, ENOVIA backend, REST APIs, etc.)

## ✅ Top Java Questions to Prepare (With Smart Developer Answers)

---

### **1. What are the basic OOP principles in Java?**

**Answer:**
Java follows 4 core OOP principles:

* **Encapsulation**: Wrapping data in classes using private fields and public getters/setters.
* **Abstraction**: Hiding complex logic using interfaces or abstract classes.
* **Inheritance**: Sharing properties/behaviors from parent to child class using `extends`.
* **Polymorphism**: Same method behaves differently — method overloading and overriding.

---

### **2. What is the difference between `==` and `.equals()` in Java?**

**Answer:**

* `==` checks **reference equality** (same memory address).
* `.equals()` checks **value equality** (content).

```java
String a = new String("hello");
String b = new String("hello");
System.out.println(a == b);       // false
System.out.println(a.equals(b));  // true
```

### **3. What is the difference between an `interface` and an `abstract class`?**

| Feature     | Interface                   | Abstract Class               |
| ----------- | --------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Inheritance | Multiple interfaces allowed | Only one abstract superclass |
| Methods     | Only abstract (Java 7)      | Can have abstract + concrete |
| Use case    | Contract                    | Partial implementation       |

---

### **4. How does Java handle memory?**

**Answer:**
Java has:

* **Heap**: For object storage (long-lived memory)
* **Stack**: For method calls, local variables
* **Garbage Collector**: Frees memory used by unreachable objects

---

### **5. What is the difference between `ArrayList` and `LinkedList`?**

| Feature       | ArrayList          | LinkedList              |
| ------------- | ------------------ | ----------------------- |
| Access speed  | Fast (index-based) | Slower (traverse nodes) |
| Insert/Delete | Slower (shifting)  | Faster (only pointers)  |
| Internal      | Array              | Doubly-linked nodes     |

---

### **6. What is a `constructor` in Java?**

**Answer:**
A constructor is a special method used to initialize objects. It's called when you use `new ClassName()`.

```java
public class Car {
  String brand;
  Car(String name) {
    this.brand = name;
  }
}
```

---

### **7. What is method overloading vs method overriding?**

* **Overloading**: Same method name, different parameters (within same class)
* **Overriding**: Subclass redefines parent class method

---

### **8. What is a `static` keyword used for?**

**Answer:**
Static means the member belongs to the **class**, not instances.

```java
static int count; // shared across all objects
```

---

### **9. What is a `final` keyword?**

* Applied to **variables** → constant (can't change)
* **Methods** → can’t override
* **Classes** → can’t extend

---

### **10. What are exceptions in Java?**

Java uses `try-catch` to handle runtime exceptions.

```java
try {
  int x = 5 / 0;
} catch (ArithmeticException e) {
  System.out.println("Divide by zero error");
}
```

There are **checked** (e.g., IOException) and **unchecked** (e.g., NullPointerException) exceptions.

## ✅ Bonus: Java in ENOVIA/Enterprise Apps

If asked:

> “Do you have experience in Java?”

You can say:

> "While my primary stack is JavaScript, I understand Java basics, especially OOP concepts, exception handling, collections, and how APIs are structured using Java. I’ve also reviewed some JPO (Java Program Object) examples used in ENOVIA customizations and feel confident reading or modifying Java code if needed."

---

### 📌 Pro Tip:

Interviewers won’t expect deep backend knowledge — **but showing curiosity and comfort with Java concepts is a big green flag.**
